# Speech-to-Text & Dialogue Enhancement Model for Streaming (Whisper + Generative AI)

This project aims to enhance dialogue clarity in noisy movie scenes using a combination of Speech-to-Text (STT) and Denoising Autoencoders (DAE). The model leverages the power of OpenAI's Whisper for accurate transcription and applies DAE to reduce background noise, significantly improving audio clarity. The project focuses on accessibility for global audiences, a key focus for streaming platforms like Netflix.

## Key Features

- Uses OpenAI Whisper or wav2vec2 for speech-to-text transcription.
- Applies Denoising Autoencoders (DAE) to clean up background noise from dialogues.
- Can be trained on public speech/audio datasets and applied to improve audio clarity in Netflix originals.
